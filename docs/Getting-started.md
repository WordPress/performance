# Start contributing to the Performance Lab plugin
This guide focuses on how to contribute to the Performance Lab plugin, from setting up the development environment to creating pull requests.

## Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

## Setup the development environment

### Clone the repository

```

### Install the local development dependencies
To install the local development dependencies, run the following command in your terminal:

### Start the local WordPress environment
The Performance Lab plugin uses Docker and [the wp-env](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-env) to start a local WordPress environment.

First, make sure Docker is installed, up and running on your machine. Then, run `npm run wp-env start` to start the WordPress environment. The WordPress development site will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Stop the local WordPress environment
The following command will stop the WordPress environment:
```
npm run wp-env stop
```

## Opening and working on issues
We use GitHub Projects as well as a few different sets of labels to ensure that issues are properly tracked and able to be easily managed by contributors. For details, please refer to our [GitHub workflow documentation](./Github-workflow.md).
