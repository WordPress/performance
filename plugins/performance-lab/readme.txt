Performance plugin from the WordPress Performance Team, which is a collection of standalone performance features.

== Description ==

The Performance Lab plugin is a collection of features focused on enhancing performance of your site, most of which should eventually be merged into WordPress core. The plugin allows to individually enable and test the features to get their benefits before they become available in WordPress core, and to provide feedback to further improve the solutions.

== Installation ==

= Installation from within WordPress =

1. Visit **Plugins > Add New**.
2. Search for **Performance Lab**.
3. Install and activate the Performance Lab plugin.

= Manual installation =

1. Upload the entire `performance-lab` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Visit **Plugins**.
3. Activate the Performance Lab plugin.

= After activation =

1. Visit the new **Settings > Performance** menu.
2. Enable the individual features you would like to use.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the purpose of this plugin? =

The primary purpose of the Performance Lab plugin is to allow testing of various performance features for which the goal is to eventually land in WordPress core. It is essentially a collection of "feature plugins", which makes it different from other performance plugins that offer performance features which are not targeted at WordPress core and potentially rely on functionality that would not be feasible to use in WordPress core. The list of available features will regularly change: Existing features may be removed after they have been released in WordPress core, while new features may be added in any release.

= Can I use this plugin on my production site? =

Per the primary purpose of the plugin (see above), it can mostly be considered a beta testing plugin for the various performance features it includes. However, it's essential to understand that utilizing it comes with inherent risks. Users are encouraged to proceed with caution and understand that they are doing so at their own risk.

= Where can I submit my plugin feedback? =

Feedback is encouraged and much appreciated, especially since this plugin is a collection of future WordPress core features. If you have suggestions or requests for new features, you can [submit them as an issue in the Performance Lab GitHub repository](https://github.com/WordPress/performance/issues/new/choose). If you need help with troubleshooting or have a question about the plugin, please [create a new topic on our support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/performance-lab/#new-topic-0).

= Where can I report security bugs? =

The Performance team and WordPress community take security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please visit the [WordPress HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/wordpress) program.

= How can I contribute to the plugin? =

Contributions are always welcome! Learn more about how to get involved in the [Core Performance Team Handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/performance/handbook/get-involved/).
