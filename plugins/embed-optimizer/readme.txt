Optimizes the performance of embeds by lazy-loading iframes and scripts.

== Description ==

This plugin's purpose is to optimize the performance of [embeds in WordPress](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/embeds/), such as YouTube videos, TikToks, and so on. Initially this is achieved by lazy-loading them only when they come into view. This improves performance because embeds are generally very resource-intensive and so lazy-loading them ensures that they don't compete with resources when the page is loading. [Other optimizations](https://github.com/WordPress/performance/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22%5BPlugin%5D+Embed+Optimizer%22) are planned for the future.
